Eventually want this to be a yaml file but for now....


conda create -n snpbin2 python=2.7
conda activate snpbin2
pip install ~/Documents/Github/SNPbinner2
# installed pillow-6.2.2 snpbinner-0.2.3

# after trying to run crosspoints, error about missing numpy
# numpy is on version 1.26.0
# numpy 1.15.0 for py2? or 1.14 maybe
# says pip install numpy on Python2 will continue to give last working release in perpetuity...
# not sure I believe that

pip install numpy=1.14
# error invalid requirement numpy=1.14, hint = is not a valid argument

pip install numpy
# successfully installed numpy 1.16.6, didn't change python version
